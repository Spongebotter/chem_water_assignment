      <h1>Eritrea</h1>
      <p>
        The area/country of my choice is Eritrea, this is the neighbouring
        country where my parents are from (Ethiopia). If Ethiopia wasn’t taken
        that would be my immediate choice but Eritrea is also close enough.
        Eritrea is located in then Horn Of Africa, which is the North Eastern
        part of Africa. With the nation being in a devestating war for three
        decades, poverty has become a huge problem. One of the many health
        conerns in this country is the quality of water the population is living
        on. This water is what this article/website will be diving into about!

    <h1>Pollutants</h1>
    <div class="facts_pollutants">
      <p>
        The cause of most of the poor drinking water is the pollution of the
        water, this pollution starts from the amount of rainfall the nation
        receives being around 15 inches annual. The water then goes into the
        sewage drains and systems, the water from the rainfall carries bacteria
        from human excrements. Then the filtering systems don’t really do a good
        job of completely cleaning the water, leading to these bacteria being
        very present in the water they drink. These bacteria cause illnesses
        like diarrhea and cholera.
      </p>
      <p>
        The water is also contaminated with a lot of nitrates, from the streets
        in Asmara (Capital City of Eritrea). “Consuming too much nitrate can be
        harmful—especially for babies.”(health.state.mn.us). The health effects
        tied to large consumption are “The following conditions may also put
        people at higher risk of developing nitrate-induced methemoglobinemia:
        anemia, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, sepsis,
        glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency, and other metabolic
        problems.”(health.state.mn.us).

      <b>Anemia</b>: Your red blood cells not being able to carry enough oxygen
      to other organs. It is also known as low hemoglobin
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Sepsis</b>: Is the highest level of infection. This infection normally
      starts in the lungs and other organs. This can lead to tissue damage or
      even death
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency</b>: a genetic disorder
      that affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues
      throughout the body.

    <h1>Standards</h1>

    <p>
      This standard is in terms of salt which is the only resource I can find in
      regards to water quality in Eritrea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organization that has come up with these standards is the World Health
      Organization; this is the head organization that deals with health crises
      all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The level of contaminants in the water is measured by TDS (Total Dissolved
      Salts), TDS is recorded in parts per million. This article states that
      “The water which comes down to Massawa from the highlands has 1,300 TDS –
      that’s Total Dissolved Salts – where the WHO (World Health Organisation)
      standard says that 500 TDS should be the maximum and in extreme cases
      could be up to 1,000. Bottled water quality is between 109 and 180 TDS.
      These high salt levels cause a lot of health problems, as they harm the
      internal organs, especially kidneys,”(Solomon Bahabla via ipsnews.net)

    <h1>Issues</h1>

    <p>
      Well, the reason why there is very little clean water is a pylon effect of
      many of the things but one of the biggest trends takes place in the
      economical side of things. Part of the economy is tied to the
      business/farming industry, “Farmers and local business owners rely, to
      some extent, on access to clean water. Farmers need to keep their crops
      clean by washing them. Local businesses also need clean water to create
      products or sell food. Without accessible clean water nearby, owners and
      employees have to leave their businesses to find a drinkable water source
      and sanitation facilities. By doing so, they could potentially lose
      customers.”(borgenproject.org). The demand to supply ratio is far off
      which leads to the inefficient amount of drinkable water for the nation.
